There a feeling of frustration I get every time the service I use and love doesn't quite do what I want, clutters me with info I don't need most of the time or distracts me from what's important. One way to solve this is to write a browser extension that would enable a second view mode, clutter-free view mode on specific sites. That's what I did.
